# Development Process
   * ### Planning
      * To start off my planning I decided to research the best way to manipulate motors in order to control them how I needed to. I made the entire circuit in [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fkpYd7mgALy-not-beebot-camerons/editel?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinkercad.com%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2Fcircuits&sharecode=hNEtSJ4X27Qa3pH9DLSsrnlikMR4CaXaWMVf1GFJPlw) before fiddling with wires in real life.
      * I found that the H-Bridge Motor Driver was the best suited to controlling the motors in the way I needed to
